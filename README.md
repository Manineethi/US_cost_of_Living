To analyze the pattern, we used the US Cost of Living dataset. It helps us figure out how much money families in different parts of the US need for things like housing, food, and healthcare. It can show us if these families have enough money to live comfortably or if they might be struggling financially. It also helps us compare the costs of living in different places and understand if certain areas are more affordable for different types of families. This information can be useful for making decisions about where to live, understanding income differences between areas, and finding out which places are more or less expensive for families.

Limitations: 

•	The absence of date-specific data
The data does not include specific dates, making it difficult to analyze trends over different months or quarters or years.
•	Restricted coverage to a limited number of counties
The dataset only covers 1,877 out of the total 3,143 counties in the US, so we cannot analyze trends in the rest of the counties.
